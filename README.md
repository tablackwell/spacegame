# spacegame
A small, super simple space shooter style game created to teach BlitzBasic to 7th-9th grade students as taught at Fairfax Collegiate this summer. It uses the BlitzBasic programming language, using the BlitzPlus IDE. The Blitz IDE is prettttttttty outdated so if you want to mess around with this code I highly recommend you look at one of the alternate IDE's the community has released. Also, in order for the game to run on Modern windows computers, you'll need to enable DirectPlay under legacy features. The assets really ought to be in separate folders, but for the sake of keeping it simple for the students I kept the files in the same directory. I'll move them into separate asset folders should I ever decide to do something more with this project.


Shoutout to eric, ryan, and jett
