# spacegame
A small, super simple space shooter style game created to teach BlitzBasic to 7th-9th grade students as taught at Fairfax Collegiate this summer. It uses the BlitzBasic programming language, using the BlitzPlus IDE. The Blitz IDE is prettttttttty outdated so if you want to mess around with this code I highly recommend you look at one of the alternate IDE's the community has released. Also, in order for the game to run on Modern windows computers, you'll need to enable DirectPlay under legacy features. Assets are in their appropriately named folders. The music is not mine, but I did make the sound effects. Feel free to use the sound effects for whatever reason. The main game loop is in "determination.bb," so you'll want to run that if you want to run the game. After I add a boss fight I'll likely end development for this game, since the engine is rather limiting. 


Shoutout to e, r, and j for being super cool students

Additional note: The code probably has a lot of inane and obvious comments, since I used this code to teach. There are also likely much smarter ways of implementing a lot of this stuff, but I wanted to keep it simple for my students.
